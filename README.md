# CSMVS Floor Map

## Description and Features
The project is about exploring the various galleries in CSMVS using the Floor Map of CSMVS. It is an app, which displays the Floor Map of CSMVS for each floor. The user needs to select the floor they want to explore and they can choose a particular Gallery they want to know more about. Each Gallery has the Photo, Name, and other Details about the various Art objects available in that gallery. The data used in the app has been provided by CSMVS and stored in Database.

## Motivation
When we visited CSMVS, we spent almost 3 to 4 hours exploring the entire museum and at end, we were not able to recall the gallery where we saw some art objects, which were very interesting. Therefore, we thought to develop an app which can display the objects and their details according to gallery and on which floor it is located. This app provides details about those objects and helps us to easily find them the next time we visit CSMVS.

## Technical Details 
It is an Android app developed using Android Studio and coded using Java and XML. The database used for the app is developed using SQLite.
